Ray Core documentation
======================

Welcome to the documentation of Ray Core! The documentation consists of two
parts:

* the system user documentation which describes the system API and how to use the
  system

* the developer documentation that describes the internals of the system and the
  developer API

These are separate from the Ray user documentation which can be found under
https://github.com/amplab/ray/blob/master/doc/introduction.md.
