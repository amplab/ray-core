Connecting to Ray services
==========================

All the Ray services expose an API via IPC that can be called by any other
services or applications. To learn more about services, please have a look
at https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/mojo and
https://github.com/amplab/ray-core/tree/master/src/docs.
