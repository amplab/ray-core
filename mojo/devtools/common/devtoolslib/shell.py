    The server will run on a separate thread until the program terminates. The
    call returns immediately.

    Args:
      mappings: List of tuples (prefix, local_base_path_list) mapping URLs that
          start with |prefix| to one or more local directories enumerated in
          |local_base_path_list|. The prefixes should skip the leading slash.
          The first matching prefix and the first location that contains the
          requested file will be used each time.
      port: port at which the server will be available to the shell. On Android
          this can be different from the port on which the server runs on the
          host.
      reuse_servers: don't actually spawn the server. Instead assume that the
          server is already running on |port|, and only set up forwarding if
          needed.

    Returns:
      The url that the shell can use to access the server.

      |output| is the stdout mingled with the stderr produced by the shell.
      |did_time_out| is True iff the shell was terminated because it exceeded
      the |timeout| and False otherwise.
