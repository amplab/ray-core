// AudioTrackToOutputLink is a small class which tracks the relationship between
// an audio track and an audio output.  Tracks and outputs are expected to hold
// strong pointers to the state in the collections they use to track their
// peers.
//
// When either a track or an output ceases to exist, its collection will clear
// releasing the reference to the shared state.  When the other half of the
// relationship realizes that its peer has gone away (typically by failing to
// promote the weak reference to its peer held in the share state object), it
// can purge the state object strong pointer from its collection triggering the
// final cleanup of the shared state.
//
// Because the final cleanup of the shared state can be triggered either from an
// output manager mixer thread, or from the audio service's main message loop,
// it must be safe to destruct all of the shared state from any thread in the
// system.  No assumptions may be made about threading when destructing.
//
// The AudioTrackToOutputLink object holds a queue of pending audio packet
// references sourced from the AudioTrack to be rendered on the audio output.
// The references are safe to release either from an output manager thread, or
// from the audio service's main message loop thread (which drives track
// behavior).
//
// Finally, both the Output may have a pointer to a Bookkeeping object in order
// to manage bookkeeping tasks specific to the Track/Output relationship.  The
// following rules must be obeyed at all times...
//
// + Derrived classes of the Bookkeeping object created by the Output must be
//   safe to destroy either thread.  During destruction, no potentially blocking
//   operations may be performed.  No heavy operations (such as logging) should
//   be performed.
// + Only the output is permitted to access the output bookkeeping.  The track
//   must make no attempts to modify the bookkeeping or its pointer.
// + Outputs must hold a strong reference to the shared link object object
//   whenever they are accessing their bookkeeping object.  The link object is
//   considered to be the owner of the Bookkeeping, users must never hold a
//   naked pointer to their bookkeeping if the link could possibly destruct.
