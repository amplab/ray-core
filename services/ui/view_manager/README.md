# Mozart View Manager

This directory contains an implementation of the ViewManager interface.
It provides a composable view management system for used by other
applications.

It doesn't make sense to run this application stand-alone since it
doesn't have any UI of its own to display.  Instead, use the Mozart
Launcher or some other application to launch and embed the UI of some
other application using the view manager.
