The files in this directory are generated by the mojom bindings generator.
Since they are used by the new version of the mojom bindings generator,
we need to check them in to break the circular dependency.

The sources are:
mojo/public/interfaces/bindings/mojom_types.mojom
mojo/public/interfaces/bindings/mojom_files.mojom

TODO(azani): Write a script that updates those files automatically.
