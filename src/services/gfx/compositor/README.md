# Mozart Compositor

This directory contains an implementation of the Compositor interface.
It provides a graphical compositor system for use by other applications.

It doesn't make sense to run this application stand-alone since it
doesn't have any UI of its own to display.  Instead, use the Mozart
Launcher or some other application to launch and embed the UI of some
other application using the view manager.
