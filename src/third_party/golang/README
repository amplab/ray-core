Description:
The src subdirectory contains a small number of Go source files
downloaded from https://golang.org/src and modified by the Mojo authors as
described below.

Local Changes:
- The fmt package has been modified with regards to how it uses reflection
to deep print Go structures:
  * Instead of only following pointers for one level we now follow pointers for
    50 levels.
  * Instead of printing the address of a string pointer we print the string.
  * Instead of printing maps in an unspecified order we sort the keys of
    the map if they are of numeric or string type.
