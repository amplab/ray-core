The code in this directory is a copy from upstream llvm. It is also a
PyPi package (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lit), but that is difficult
for us to consume via DEPS. Since this isn't change much, this is just
a copy.

With the exception of this README, the code in this directory was
taken from llvm revision 250162. It is exactly the contents of
//utils/lit, plus the top level LICENSE.txt file.
